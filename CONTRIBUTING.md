# Contributing to [ai\_messenger][repository-github-url]

## 🚧 Early Development Phase

**ai_messenger** is currently in the very early stages of development. The project is actively being architected and the core foundation is still being built.

**Contributions are not being accepted at this time** as the project structure, APIs, and fundamental design decisions are still in flux. We appreciate your interest, but please check back once the project reaches a more stable state.

If you're interested in following the project's progress, feel free to:
- ⭐ Star the repository to stay updated
- 👀 Watch for releases and major milestones
- 📝 Open an issue if you have suggestions or find bugs (though major changes are expected)

We'll update this document once the project is ready for community contributions.
